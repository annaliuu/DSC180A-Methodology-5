#### **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered this quarter was just learning more about the LangChain framework and using this framework to simulate a real person. I was able to deep dive
into political data and create agents and personas to perform in context learning.

#### **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
Something I would like to pursue further next quarter would be ways to better refine LangChain models. We were able to play around with these models this quarter already, but I think it
would be interesting to explore even more ways of hypertuning the different parameters. LangChain is such a powerful framework, so I hope to just be able to learn more about its
applications.

#### **3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
As of now, we are currently using the agents we built from LangChain to perform analyses and predictions regarding political data. However, this is extremely computationally
expensive and does not scale well, especially with the large amounts of data we are using. Thus, we plan to experiment with various types of large language models to better optimize
the speed and efficiency at which things can be processed.

#### **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would also be interested in experimenting with different large language models and frameworks in addition to just the LangChain framework. I think it would be nice to compare and
contrast various models and see which one performs the best and is the most efficient in terms of our project.
